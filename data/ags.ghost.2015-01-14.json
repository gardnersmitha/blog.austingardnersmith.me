And it's because I fell in love with Keynote before it, and Photoshop a long time before that. \n\nEach of those applications contained one main feature that changed the game for me. From Photoshop, it was the graphical display of layers with controls available at each layer. And from Keynote, it was the ability to simply and easily select layers, objects, and groups by simply clicking on them in the visual display - a feature is now seems so obvious that its absence in PowerPoint makes that application an absolute terror to use.\n\nBoth of these features come standard in Sketch. Still better news is that a whole bunch of features found in other applications have been left out of Sketch on purpose, leaving the interface uncluttered and response times fast. \n\n### Awesome Stuff\n\nAside from the two big ones, Sketch offers a number of other benefits:\n\n- Artboards\n\n    The application supports artboards that are easily duplicable in the user interface. You can copy, drag, and replicate a new version of the screen you were just working on in only a few clicks. \n\n- 100% Vector\n\n    Sketch is also 100% vector, which makes scaling up and down supremely easy, and is especially useful when designing text-heavy interfaces. \n\n- Export Tools\n    \n    Lots of slick export tools, built right into the interface, make it easy as pie to get your images out of Sketch and into raster images or PDFs that others can digest. \n\n- Plugins\n    \n    The Sketch community is still small, but there are a number of plugins available for the app that allow you to extend its core functionality. By far the most useful of these I've found is this [symbols](https://github.com/tisho/sketch-plugins/tree/master/Symbols) plugin, which creates Fireworks-esque symbol capabilities in Sketch. Boom. \n\n- iOS Mirror\n\n    Sketch has a companion iOS app called [Sketch Mirror](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/mirror/) that allows you to see a preview of your design on your device in real time. No more exporting, mailing and opening on the device. If you're an iOS designer, this is an incredible feature.\n\n###Drawbacks\n\nAs with any new product, there are bound to be some drawbacks. Here are the most obvious ones I've discovered with Sketch so far:\n\n- Usage\n\n    Relative to the big boys in the space, Sketch has small adoption, which means that you'll likely be the only person in your office using it.  \n\n- Lag\n\n    At larger file sizes, I've started to notice some lag in the rendering behind my documents. This can be frustrating when you're trying to move around a document with a lot of artboards, each being used to display a specific screen in your application. It's solvable by breaking your screens out into different documents, but hopefully is something the team at Sketch will get better at over time. \n\n- Funkiness\n\n    You'll encounter the occasional weirdness in Sketch, such as rulers that don't always move how you want them to or phantom layers that don't seem to move where you put them. These are to be expected from an app that's still in heavy development, and they're usually solved by a simple restart. It's really not that big of a deal, and if you have a specific problem I've found the support team to be very responsive. \n\n\nOverall, my experience with Sketch has been super positive, and I'm not planning on going back to either Keynote or Photoshop for my UI needs anytime soon. The application has enabled me to work quicker and with more precision, and I hope to convert more of my team in the future so we can all share in the glory of 100% vector, 100% easy designs. \n","html":"<p>I've never fallen in love with an app  so fast, and so hard, as I fell in love with <a href=\"http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/\">Sketch</a>.

I encountered this opportunity through [GA](http://generalassemb.ly), where I'm teaching the third installment of a very hands-on digital marketing class. \n\nDespite an explicit interest in socially-based enterprises at past points in my life (I still have a passion for zero-impact architecture and renewable energy; basically, the off-the-grid lifestyle), I hadn't been actively involved in the community, by fault or by accident. I was thinking I would throw a few slides together and then go get a few beers. \n\nThen I got the resumes. These people were impressive. Many folks have graduate degrees. Many folks have other degrees in focused but impressive areas of study, like Computer Science and Theoretical Economics. Others are in the process of getting their MBA's at places like \"Harvard\" or \"Stanford\" or \"M.I.T.\" or \"Wharton.\" You know, the small liberal arts schools. \n\nSo I changed the talk. I had to speak about marketing, the topic I knew best, in short but frank terms. I had to be a 'domain expert,' but because of the other expertise in the room I would have to make my domain narrow and interesting. \n\nHere's where I ended up with the talk, with quick bit of narration following each slide. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13547?token=mVVpofnpBhlWDKwAuveNe1gxSgM1Bx3qUxKtAUEgIEZyJzhKAbTNX_pD0x9o20zWNqEFmJE5aPzkhUfzPa0LdeA) \n\nGave a quick blurb on who I am and why I'm here talking today. I've spent time at a non-profit and been advisor to another, did a term at a media startup, worked at an ad agency for three years, and ended up back in digital advertising technology.\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13548?token=fgZTn6I7bzSvJdvoM6uS4R3Ch7FEqsXOtSVuyD0Wk6mS9JbWik6XCTqrn6KC-MZDshu1uJ8oZ2uccthG3VZamM0) \n\nFigured we should start with digital marketing as topic. Wanted to speak really quickly about what digital marketing means; I still feel like it's just marketing in a world that's mostly digital - a small but subtle difference that helps alleviate imposter syndrome in audiences (and myself). \n\nIt's been moving so rapidly, and lots of people have this intrinsic feeling that they're lost. That they're behind. That they've somehow missed the boat. \n\nThe fact is, the whole digital marketing industry is very nascent. And in its early stages, there are leaders and followers. The leaders are very sophisticated; they spend millions of dollars a year on digital marketing and often have incredibly sophisticated operations teams behind their efforts. These are brands like Red Bull and GEICO and Nike, who have large teams charged with making  sure their digital marketing footprints are large and influential. Together, they contribute a huge amount of the total digital advertising market spend. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13549?token=Y3gcGX50c67_mGgZhipCMiloZgMMlc-2uQmG6sX-gHVSWos2027_m04tu858ml5TWri0_dv9cOkFCyXqcSeVOXI) \n\nEmarketer estimates this number at somewhere in the neighborhood of $50B. That's not nearly an insignificant market. For comparison, the TV market is estimated at around $70M. And just as an FYI, Facebook is estimated to take home about $4B of the total digital market, Google about $20B (I think both of those numbers are **low**, by the way). But that $50B number doesn't represent the full potential of the market - not even close.\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13551?token=8HlZJXJv36aFV77RRYDQpECAo3g4jGJY4bdTO5orvxrtcZVtkydzaIj9yl3vofwB0SnIwHY5xI_2Z_OyrJQygeA) \n\nMost estimates have small businesses marked down as responsible for somewhere north of 50% of the Unites States GDP; yet only a very small percentage of their marketing dollars are being directed toward digital channels. \n\nThis isn't because theyre slow to react, or technologically inferior, or just old and clueless. It's at least in part because the tools weren't there yet. Google Adwords as we know it is only about ten years old; Facebook is just getting out of diapers in year five, and Twitter is barely toddling less than a year after its public release. \n\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13555?token=aKUrb9C4dFeg0MSxjLExIiQUmcnP4fPzEJDIsW9EhHylLdyxTALUGxTPchDHfcACzKybMa-dnfLOL_dIU4KluKE) \n\nThat's all about to change.

The folks at HBS did a great job organizing (shocker) and all of the attendees and participants were beyond impressive. \n\nAt the end of the day, there are some really great social enterprise ideas out there, and I think lots of them line up *really* well with today's digital marketing tools and objectives. \n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>A few months ago, I had the great opportunity to go to HBS and run a workshop that centered around digital marketing for social enterprises. I encountered this opportunity through <a href=\"http://generalassemb.ly\">GA</a>, where I'm teaching the third installment of a very hands-on digital marketing class. </p>\n\n<p>Despite an explicit interest in socially-based enterprises at past points in my life (I still have a passion for zero-impact architecture and renewable energy; basically, the off-the-grid lifestyle), I hadn't been actively involved in the community, by fault or by accident. I was thinking I would throw a few slides together and then go get a few beers. </p>\n\n<p>Then I got the resumes. These people were impressive. Many folks have graduate degrees. Many folks have other degrees in focused but impressive areas of study, like Computer Science and Theoretical Economics. Others are in the process of getting their MBA's at places like \"Harvard\" or \"Stanford\" or \"M.I.T.\" or \"Wharton.\" You know, the small liberal arts schools. </p>\n\n<p>So I changed the talk. I had to speak about marketing, the topic I knew best, in short but frank terms. I had to be a 'domain expert,' but because of the other expertise in the room I would have to make my domain narrow and interesting. </p>\n\n<p>Here's where I ended up with the talk, with quick bit of narration following each slide. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13547?token=mVVpofnpBhlWDKwAuveNe1gxSgM1Bx3qUxKtAUEgIEZyJzhKAbTNX_pD0x9o20zWNqEFmJE5aPzkhUfzPa0LdeA\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Gave a quick blurb on who I am and why I'm here talking today. I've spent time at a non-profit and been advisor to another, did a term at a media startup, worked at an ad agency for three years, and ended up back in digital advertising technology.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13548?token=fgZTn6I7bzSvJdvoM6uS4R3Ch7FEqsXOtSVuyD0Wk6mS9JbWik6XCTqrn6KC-MZDshu1uJ8oZ2uccthG3VZamM0\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Figured we should start with digital marketing as topic. Wanted to speak really quickly about what digital marketing means; I still feel like it's just marketing in a world that's mostly digital - a small but subtle difference that helps alleviate imposter syndrome in audiences (and myself). </p>\n\n<p>It's been moving so rapidly, and lots of people have this intrinsic feeling that they're lost. That they're behind. That they've somehow missed the boat. </p>\n\n<p>The fact is, the whole digital marketing industry is very nascent. And in its early stages, there are leaders and followers. The leaders are very sophisticated; they spend millions of dollars a year on digital marketing and often have incredibly sophisticated operations teams behind their efforts. These are brands like Red Bull and GEICO and Nike, who have large teams charged with making  sure their digital marketing footprints are large and influential. Together, they contribute a huge amount of the total digital advertising market spend. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13549?token=Y3gcGX50c67_mGgZhipCMiloZgMMlc-2uQmG6sX-gHVSWos2027_m04tu858ml5TWri0_dv9cOkFCyXqcSeVOXI\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Emarketer estimates this number at somewhere in the neighborhood of $50B. That's not nearly an insignificant market. For comparison, the TV market is estimated at around $70M. And just as an FYI, Facebook is estimated to take home about $4B of the total digital market, Google about $20B (I think both of those numbers are <strong>low</strong>, by the way). But that $50B number doesn't represent the full potential of the market - not even close.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13551?token=8HlZJXJv36aFV77RRYDQpECAo3g4jGJY4bdTO5orvxrtcZVtkydzaIj9yl3vofwB0SnIwHY5xI_2Z_OyrJQygeA\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Most estimates have small businesses marked down as responsible for somewhere north of 50% of the Unites States GDP; yet only a very small percentage of their marketing dollars are being directed toward digital channels. </p>\n\n<p>This isn't because theyre slow to react, or technologically inferior, or just old and clueless. It's at least in part because the tools weren't there yet. Google Adwords as we know it is only about ten years old; Facebook is just getting out of diapers in year five, and Twitter is barely toddling less than a year after its public release. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13555?token=aKUrb9C4dFeg0MSxjLExIiQUmcnP4fPzEJDIsW9EhHylLdyxTALUGxTPchDHfcACzKybMa-dnfLOL_dIU4KluKE\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>That's all about to change.

Personally, I find it amusing, if trivial. But there are a few reasons why I think it's gained popularity, and a few UX lessons to take away. \n\n####The 'ping' isn't a new concept\nWe've long talked about 'pinging' someone, whether they're across the office or across the ocean. It's a simple act of getting someone's attention, seeing what they are up to, or just letting them know you're thinking about them. Yet very few apps have made functionality that serves this very stripped-down use case - most require us to send some kind of additional message along with the ping. So it's not like Yo created a new behavior - it simply supports an incredibly simple and obvious existing behavior.\n####Push notifications *are* an interface\nMost mobile app interfaces happen within the application itself, and as designers and developers we're usually thinking about how people use our products when we have their full attention. But this is actually fairly uncommon - it's far more likely that users are doing [something other than using our app](http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/02/how-many-apps-do-you-use-a-month-study-shows-the-average-is-26-poll/) or site at any given moment. The result is that many of our interactions with services, particularly on mobile devices, occur in the form of push notifications. Other apps have embraced this ([ESPN's ScoreCenter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDcQFjAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fespn-sportscenter%2Fid317469184%3Fmt%3D8&ei=1Tm8U9GnE9PKsQSf4YLgCA&usg=AFQjCNGHyTocuMSoQYTuXCLwdT8iL4Y72g&sig2=Za8o7ISvUaSFxb3UlcY7fQ&bvm=bv.70138588,d.bGQ) comes to mind as an app I primarily interact with via notifications) but Yo takes the paradigm to its logical extreme, making the notification itself the whole of the interaction. \n####Short messages are really common\nI have saved shortcut on my iPhone keyboard that allows me to send the message 'Status' by double-tapping the `s` key, and it's probably the second most common thing I send via iMessage or SMS (the first is '10-4', shortcut `zz` to minimize distance from input field to keystroke). I'm sure I'm not alone in this \"micro-messaging\" behavior. Keyboard shortcuts are a nice way to accomplish my objective, but the fact is that for these use cases, a standard messaging UX is far more complicated than it needs to be. Yo fills a similar need - and those of my friends who use it are getting far fewer 'Status' messages from me these days. \n####Context is everything (and it always has been)\nA Yo at 10AM on a Monday from a colleague means something different than a Yo from a friend at 4:30PM on a Thursday. And they both mean something different than a Yo from an accomplice early on Sunday morning after a long night out. Context has always been a key to understanding when it comes to messaging (and all forms of communication, really) - often times it can communicate more information than the content of the message itself. So even with Yo's restrictive messaging capability - literally the same two characters every time - it remains remarkably adept at communicating sentiment. You really don't lose that much in translation, especially when you start adding dimensions like response time (how quickly I get a 'Yo' back), frequency (how often they 'Yo' me), and repetition (how many successive 'Yo's there are). \n####There will be more messages, silly\nThe radical simplicity of Yo is part of its novelty and a large reason for its strong initial traction, but that doesn't mean its utility would be entirely diluted by adding more messages. The interface could easily be tweaked to add more messages (think swiping the whole contact list right or left to move between 'Yo' and 'Sup'), and you can considerably increase its functionality without adding much friction or removing much of the user delight that goes with the current, uber-minimal approach. And if I could configure 4-5 of my own one word quips, it could probably steal another 10% of the interactions I currently have with iMessage.\n\nWill Yo become the hottest app of the century? Probably not. Will it ever be enough of a commercial success to justify the hype and funding it's received to date? Unlikely, in my opinion. But it most certainly isn't as stupid as it appears at first glance, and there are lots of little lessons to be learned when it comes to mobile, UX, and the way we'll all communicate in the future.
