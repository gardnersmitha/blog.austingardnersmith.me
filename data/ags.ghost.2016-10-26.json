The reason I'm writing this post, and the reason you're reading here, on this new blog, is a great example of how one act of discovery can lead to another, and another, and another. \n\nI used Google Reader a long time ago, and when it was sunset [a few months ago](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html), everyone made a big fuss about [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com). I'd used it before, basically as a skin for my existing and then-well-kept Reader account, in the form of a Firefox plugin. Its [rebirth]( http://gizmodo.com/5993163/feedly-reborn-the-best-google-reader-replacement-just-got-better) as a standalone web app was a unique time to revisit the application, especially given that I'd long since abandoned my Reader account for a combination of things that included Twitter, a small collection of RSS feeds that plug directly into [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) using [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/), and a couple of email newsletters. \n\nThe short result is that new Feedly worked well for me. I started up some folders, searched for publications I knew of, and added others that were suggested to me. One of the publications suggested while I was building a UX folder was [Little Big Details](http://littlebigdetails.com/). And as it turned out, one of the very first things I saw on Little Big Details was [this post](http://littlebigdetails.com/post/76001160841/draft-theres-a-hemingway-mode-that-prevents-you) highlighting a feature within [Draft](https://draftin.com). Remember Draft? It's supposed to be a post about Draft. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/12067?token=tkDxYw9anPVCQphz1bfDDxSBn-OyAjECaSW0bPxmLNZFAPX7ekKkdYsVyvZ_etea-t4LIiP_FhMJauyLIzeNtjQ)\n\nTurns out, Draft is a pretty amazing tool. At its core, it's a web-based writing application with a minimal interface. But a quick peek beneath the surface reveals many more features that are really quite impressive. Since the [Draft docs](*link) do a great job of detailing each of them (with a touch of entertaining snark, to boot), I'll spare you the gritty details and instead highlight a few of the ones I think are particularly awesome. \n\n1. ####Version control\n\n    If you've ever written code, at some point you've probably encountered some kind of version control software like Git or SVN. And though you could always have just fired up a new repository for your non-code documents, no one ever really did. Draft gives you all the features you might find in version control system GUI, making it easy to work with collaborators, merge changes, tag versions, and the like. It's nifty and simple. Good work, Draft. \n\n2. ####Publishing\n\n    Draft lets you publish your writing with one click to a ton of platforms, including Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress, Ghost, SVBTLE and more. It's easy, and extensible, and generally awesome. No need to fuss around with seventeen different WSIWYG editors with their own kinks and bugs. Just write in Draft, publish everywhere. Could be a Tweet, could be a novel. Same deal. \n\n3. ####Auto Simplify\n\n\n    I haven't really used this feature much, but that may because I'm still in awe that it exists. You click a button, and your writing gets better. It's got lots features (including some that were [just released](http://ninjasandrobots.com/draft-announcements-write-even-better-twitter-cards-and-more#simple) today), but the basic idea is that the application can help eliminate weak writing, shorten your run-on sentences, and generally make the world suffer less when they read your next blog post. It's really quite impressive. \n\nI'm still in the early stages of using Draft, and I haven't yet explored the entire feature set. But I can say that it's already made me _want_ to write more, just so I can use the product. And that's a pretty amazing thing in its own right. \n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>I've always been interested in the patterns behind application discovery - the many different ways people come to find cool new websites and apps that they suddenly can't live without.

Its <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5993163/feedly-reborn-the-best-google-reader-replacement-just-got-better\">rebirth</a> as a standalone web app was a unique time to revisit the application, especially given that I'd long since abandoned my Reader account for a combination of things that included Twitter, a small collection of RSS feeds that plug directly into <a href=\"http://instapaper.com\">Instapaper</a> using <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTT</a>, and a couple of email newsletters. </p>\n\n<p>The short result is that new Feedly worked well for me. I started up some folders, searched for publications I knew of, and added others that were suggested to me. One of the publications suggested while I was building a UX folder was <a href=\"http://littlebigdetails.com/\">Little Big Details</a>. And as it turned out, one of the very first things I saw on Little Big Details was <a href=\"http://littlebigdetails.com/post/76001160841/draft-theres-a-hemingway-mode-that-prevents-you\">this post</a> highlighting a feature within <a href=\"https://draftin.com\">Draft</a>. Remember Draft? It's supposed to be a post about Draft. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/12067?token=tkDxYw9anPVCQphz1bfDDxSBn-OyAjECaSW0bPxmLNZFAPX7ekKkdYsVyvZ_etea-t4LIiP_FhMJauyLIzeNtjQ\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Turns out, Draft is a pretty amazing tool. At its core, it's a web-based writing application with a minimal interface. But a quick peek beneath the surface reveals many more features that are really quite impressive. Since the <a href=\"*link\">Draft docs</a> do a great job of detailing each of them (with a touch of entertaining snark, to boot), I'll spare you the gritty details and instead highlight a few of the ones I think are particularly awesome. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><h4 id=\"versioncontrol\">Version control</h4>\n\n<p>If you've ever written code, at some point you've probably encountered some kind of version control software like Git or SVN. And though you could always have just fired up a new repository for your non-code documents, no one ever really did. Draft gives you all the features you might find in version control system GUI, making it easy to work with collaborators, merge changes, tag versions, and the like. It's nifty and simple. Good work, Draft. </p></li>\n<li><h4 id=\"publishing\">Publishing</h4>\n\n<p>Draft lets you publish your writing with one click to a ton of platforms, including Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress, Ghost, SVBTLE and more. It's easy, and extensible, and generally awesome. No need to fuss around with seventeen different WSIWYG editors with their own kinks and bugs. Just write in Draft, publish everywhere. Could be a Tweet, could be a novel. Same deal. </p></li>\n<li><h4 id=\"autosimplify\">Auto Simplify</h4>\n\n<p>I haven't really used this feature much, but that may because I'm still in awe that it exists. You click a button, and your writing gets better. It's got lots features (including some that were <a href=\"http://ninjasandrobots.com/draft-announcements-write-even-better-twitter-cards-and-more#simple\">just released</a> today), but the basic idea is that the application can help eliminate weak writing, shorten your run-on sentences, and generally make the world suffer less when they read your next blog post. It's really quite impressive. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm still in the early stages of using Draft, and I haven't yet explored the entire feature set. But I can say that it's already made me <em>want</em> to write more, just so I can use the product. And that's a pretty amazing thing in its own right. </p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-03-05T02:47:04.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-07-13T16:04:37.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-03-05T22:57:48.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":6,"uuid":"c6ddaa90-6d40-494c-820d-ce80c4d6d878","title":"Sketch App Review (3 Months In)","slug":"sketch-app-review-3-months-in","markdown":"\n\nI've never fallen in love with an app  so fast, and so hard, as I fell in love with [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). And it's because I fell in love with Keynote before it, and Photoshop a long time before that. \n\nEach of those applications contained one main feature that changed the game for me. From Photoshop, it was the graphical display of layers with controls available at each layer. And from Keynote, it was the ability to simply and easily select layers, objects, and groups by simply clicking on them in the visual display - a feature is now seems so obvious that its absence in PowerPoint makes that application an absolute terror to use.\n\nBoth of these features come standard in Sketch. Still better news is that a whole bunch of features found in other applications have been left out of Sketch on purpose, leaving the interface uncluttered and response times fast. \n\n### Awesome Stuff\n\nAside from the two big ones, Sketch offers a number of other benefits:\n\n- Artboards\n\n    The application supports artboards that are easily duplicable in the user interface. You can copy, drag, and replicate a new version of the screen you were just working on in only a few clicks. \n\n- 100% Vector\n\n    Sketch is also 100% vector, which makes scaling up and down supremely easy, and is especially useful when designing text-heavy interfaces. \n\n- Export Tools\n    \n    Lots of slick export tools, built right into the interface, make it easy as pie to get your images out of Sketch and into raster images or PDFs that others can digest. \n\n- Plugins\n    \n    The Sketch community is still small, but there are a number of plugins available for the app that allow you to extend its core functionality. By far the most useful of these I've found is this [symbols](https://github.com/tisho/sketch-plugins/tree/master/Symbols) plugin, which creates Fireworks-esque symbol capabilities in Sketch. Boom. \n\n- iOS Mirror\n\n    Sketch has a companion iOS app called [Sketch Mirror](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/mirror/) that allows you to see a preview of your design on your device in real time. No more exporting, mailing and opening on the device. If you're an iOS designer, this is an incredible feature.\n\n###Drawbacks\n\nAs with any new product, there are bound to be some drawbacks. Here are the most obvious ones I've discovered with Sketch so far:\n\n- Usage\n\n    Relative to the big boys in the space, Sketch has small adoption, which means that you'll likely be the only person in your office using it.  \n\n- Lag\n\n    At larger file sizes, I've started to notice some lag in the rendering behind my documents. This can be frustrating when you're trying to move around a document with a lot of artboards, each being used to display a specific screen in your application. It's solvable by breaking your screens out into different documents, but hopefully is something the team at Sketch will get better at over time. \n\n- Funkiness\n\n    You'll encounter the occasional weirdness in Sketch, such as rulers that don't always move how you want them to or phantom layers that don't seem to move where you put them. These are to be expected from an app that's still in heavy development, and they're usually solved by a simple restart. It's really not that big of a deal, and if you have a specific problem I've found the support team to be very responsive. \n\n\nOverall, my experience with Sketch has been super positive, and I'm not planning on going back to either Keynote or Photoshop for my UI needs anytime soon. The application has enabled me to work quicker and with more precision, and I hope to convert more of my team in the future so we can all share in the glory of 100% vector, 100% easy designs. \n","html":"<p>I've never fallen in love with an app  so fast, and so hard, as I fell in love with <a href=\"http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/\">Sketch</a>.

I encountered this opportunity through [GA](http://generalassemb.ly), where I'm teaching the third installment of a very hands-on digital marketing class. \n\nDespite an explicit interest in socially-based enterprises at past points in my life (I still have a passion for zero-impact architecture and renewable energy; basically, the off-the-grid lifestyle), I hadn't been actively involved in the community, by fault or by accident. I was thinking I would throw a few slides together and then go get a few beers. \n\nThen I got the resumes. These people were impressive. Many folks have graduate degrees. Many folks have other degrees in focused but impressive areas of study, like Computer Science and Theoretical Economics. Others are in the process of getting their MBA's at places like \"Harvard\" or \"Stanford\" or \"M.I.T.\" or \"Wharton.\" You know, the small liberal arts schools. \n\nSo I changed the talk. I had to speak about marketing, the topic I knew best, in short but frank terms. I had to be a 'domain expert,' but because of the other expertise in the room I would have to make my domain narrow and interesting. \n\nHere's where I ended up with the talk, with quick bit of narration following each slide. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13547?token=mVVpofnpBhlWDKwAuveNe1gxSgM1Bx3qUxKtAUEgIEZyJzhKAbTNX_pD0x9o20zWNqEFmJE5aPzkhUfzPa0LdeA) \n\nGave a quick blurb on who I am and why I'm here talking today. I've spent time at a non-profit and been advisor to another, did a term at a media startup, worked at an ad agency for three years, and ended up back in digital advertising technology.\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13548?token=fgZTn6I7bzSvJdvoM6uS4R3Ch7FEqsXOtSVuyD0Wk6mS9JbWik6XCTqrn6KC-MZDshu1uJ8oZ2uccthG3VZamM0) \n\nFigured we should start with digital marketing as topic. Wanted to speak really quickly about what digital marketing means; I still feel like it's just marketing in a world that's mostly digital - a small but subtle difference that helps alleviate imposter syndrome in audiences (and myself). \n\nIt's been moving so rapidly, and lots of people have this intrinsic feeling that they're lost. That they're behind. That they've somehow missed the boat. \n\nThe fact is, the whole digital marketing industry is very nascent. And in its early stages, there are leaders and followers. The leaders are very sophisticated; they spend millions of dollars a year on digital marketing and often have incredibly sophisticated operations teams behind their efforts. These are brands like Red Bull and GEICO and Nike, who have large teams charged with making  sure their digital marketing footprints are large and influential. Together, they contribute a huge amount of the total digital advertising market spend. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13549?token=Y3gcGX50c67_mGgZhipCMiloZgMMlc-2uQmG6sX-gHVSWos2027_m04tu858ml5TWri0_dv9cOkFCyXqcSeVOXI) \n\nEmarketer estimates this number at somewhere in the neighborhood of $50B. That's not nearly an insignificant market. For comparison, the TV market is estimated at around $70M. And just as an FYI, Facebook is estimated to take home about $4B of the total digital market, Google about $20B (I think both of those numbers are **low**, by the way). But that $50B number doesn't represent the full potential of the market - not even close.\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13551?token=8HlZJXJv36aFV77RRYDQpECAo3g4jGJY4bdTO5orvxrtcZVtkydzaIj9yl3vofwB0SnIwHY5xI_2Z_OyrJQygeA) \n\nMost estimates have small businesses marked down as responsible for somewhere north of 50% of the Unites States GDP; yet only a very small percentage of their marketing dollars are being directed toward digital channels. \n\nThis isn't because theyre slow to react, or technologically inferior, or just old and clueless. It's at least in part because the tools weren't there yet. Google Adwords as we know it is only about ten years old; Facebook is just getting out of diapers in year five, and Twitter is barely toddling less than a year after its public release. \n\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13555?token=aKUrb9C4dFeg0MSxjLExIiQUmcnP4fPzEJDIsW9EhHylLdyxTALUGxTPchDHfcACzKybMa-dnfLOL_dIU4KluKE) \n\nThat's all about to change. All of the advertising tools on these platforms are just becoming available, and they'll continue to be useful for some time to come. They deliver reach and scale at prices that haven't been possible before today. These self-service tools have the power to disrupt the whole industry, and social enterprises are uniquely positioned to benefit. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13860?token=30n0vpUq6C3vq_vpon-GhPRRQiPsUDLf0crpzUUY2Ghn8RgW1uHpl5NTCmuCk-r9oG3a7BUcHOFVBkx-BH-8IAQ) \n\nSocial enterprise isn't completely different from for-profit business, but there are two big differences that I actually think make social enterprises naturally pre-disposed to marketing success.\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13861?token=K9X6X7xYe8-CEzLkq1C0PEqU-Qy9k_ezgXedLzOunwnZ-dvAx9QtXraNTbfzdzmqCisHG4_jHkgJ5qooKHQug_s)\n\nThe first is that social enterprises, by definition, have an vested interest in helping make society better. They are all about doing something that benefits lots of people without asking for a whole lot in return. This means that they have a built-in 'human interest' angle that can be used as a starting point to tell a great story. Many other kinds of organizations need to manufacture their stories in order to generate broad appeal. Social enterprises (hopefully) don't need to do this kind of manufacturing. The mission *is* the message. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13862?token=m6uAE0jQ8lVyS0s641KIl7z0VFbxi3cK4ElAPE78gBQW6zU-dTtMy8KZ_WxgxIGh4XKe5w5BaQ8GmfxPoLWWt4w) \n\nThe second thing that's unique to social enterprise is that their stated objective is impact, not profit. Marketing is, in many ways, itself all about creating impact among a target audience. So the fact that social enterprises have impact as a core competency makes them unusually pre-disposed to marketing activities - many of the core principles are the same. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13863?token=nEEYbuHhptAQZMw9HToIecNTf6wJnm0o-873Fp6Ip52AD7lsplnpsi6esLFp1UHEeeC2Y0g4vGwVua-iIucsjKk) \n\nSo what happens when we combine the digital marketing and social enterprise?\n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13864?token=aXZ6lma-2y4DPtHdTFwXqF_wTMTNh6BVeGjB_h-5mHCqN_WbKwja7VDZN95D06jN4Jq02HrK2qgmmjh6SDO-0NQ) \n\nWell, we've already said that the biggest takeaway from the digital marketing landscape is rapidly expanding access to tools that enable reach at scale, and that social enterprises have built in human interest and impact as a core competency. That seems like a great situation to have on our hands. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13865?token=tOH5aF1EsepkWBmWhyqaRB_AuKyD2RVTIvwPR6nKlaAiL8s6HHBwa2uH3GeP0KZJXKIHpgkdvCgrAevcMteE0D4) \n\nAnd one that makes for happy social enterprise marketers. \n\n![](https://draftin.com:443/images/13866?token=53e3q1I5ThyGgOwee0ohBNlQoQo0MzBkBJ26ZD5OFz7bwWn4EmEV3Wsx_VdGmEAHqDwjCJljhrbM63j9ytTtNXw) \n\nBut in general, these two things together represent a great opportunity for marketing success. \n\n---\n\nPhew. I then pivoted into the more workshop-y period of the session, starting with a simple framework I use often to introduce a structured way of thinking about marketing. It's based on the premise that a lot of folks start by thinking about marketing *activities* (OMG I need a Pinterest, like, yesterday!), without actually thinking about the higher-level marketing objectives that really match up with the business. I'll spare the narrative, but here are the slides I used to demonstrate the framework:\n\n\n![SECON_Deck_v2.016.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/16557?token=C58XiypihBL_CbeSR9Tqs7e13lN8guXyVt-hGXhRl-H3nchJyyh0CjFThVJa5uNOnkmEH0spjs14LJlElSizT7Q) \n\n![SECON_Deck_v2.017.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/16558?token=HrQYcD-82a91YrdMGciOQA5WBIrTSWh6uXy_Is_j6RkycAgEZJhTlSpLun7ABw8BOBxX2cYfUgK5b9lmTj8sI2M) \n\n![SECON_Deck_v2.018.jpg](https://draftin.com:443/images/16559?token=oF67Lo9U4DvIvE2Tx5c3QgNNL1lQjmRBGfXTuIIuxb8xTWRHN1H-wxviBsLxlOz6A9dfkJQw8DDYb8ukAHlJVAs) \n\nAll in all, the workshop was a great experience and an awesome opportunity. The folks at HBS did a great job organizing (shocker) and all of the attendees and participants were beyond impressive. \n\nAt the end of the day, there are some really great social enterprise ideas out there, and I think lots of them line up *really* well with today's digital marketing tools and objectives. \n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>A few months ago, I had the great opportunity to go to HBS and run a workshop that centered around digital marketing for social enterprises.

These self-service tools have the power to disrupt the whole industry, and social enterprises are uniquely positioned to benefit. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13860?token=30n0vpUq6C3vq_vpon-GhPRRQiPsUDLf0crpzUUY2Ghn8RgW1uHpl5NTCmuCk-r9oG3a7BUcHOFVBkx-BH-8IAQ\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Social enterprise isn't completely different from for-profit business, but there are two big differences that I actually think make social enterprises naturally pre-disposed to marketing success.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13861?token=K9X6X7xYe8-CEzLkq1C0PEqU-Qy9k_ezgXedLzOunwnZ-dvAx9QtXraNTbfzdzmqCisHG4_jHkgJ5qooKHQug_s\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The first is that social enterprises, by definition, have an vested interest in helping make society better. They are all about doing something that benefits lots of people without asking for a whole lot in return. This means that they have a built-in 'human interest' angle that can be used as a starting point to tell a great story. Many other kinds of organizations need to manufacture their stories in order to generate broad appeal. Social enterprises (hopefully) don't need to do this kind of manufacturing. The mission <em>is</em> the message. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13862?token=m6uAE0jQ8lVyS0s641KIl7z0VFbxi3cK4ElAPE78gBQW6zU-dTtMy8KZ_WxgxIGh4XKe5w5BaQ8GmfxPoLWWt4w\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>The second thing that's unique to social enterprise is that their stated objective is impact, not profit. Marketing is, in many ways, itself all about creating impact among a target audience. So the fact that social enterprises have impact as a core competency makes them unusually pre-disposed to marketing activities - many of the core principles are the same. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13863?token=nEEYbuHhptAQZMw9HToIecNTf6wJnm0o-873Fp6Ip52AD7lsplnpsi6esLFp1UHEeeC2Y0g4vGwVua-iIucsjKk\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>So what happens when we combine the digital marketing and social enterprise?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13864?token=aXZ6lma-2y4DPtHdTFwXqF_wTMTNh6BVeGjB_h-5mHCqN_WbKwja7VDZN95D06jN4Jq02HrK2qgmmjh6SDO-0NQ\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>Well, we've already said that the biggest takeaway from the digital marketing landscape is rapidly expanding access to tools that enable reach at scale, and that social enterprises have built in human interest and impact as a core competency. That seems like a great situation to have on our hands. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13865?token=tOH5aF1EsepkWBmWhyqaRB_AuKyD2RVTIvwPR6nKlaAiL8s6HHBwa2uH3GeP0KZJXKIHpgkdvCgrAevcMteE0D4\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>And one that makes for happy social enterprise marketers. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13866?token=53e3q1I5ThyGgOwee0ohBNlQoQo0MzBkBJ26ZD5OFz7bwWn4EmEV3Wsx_VdGmEAHqDwjCJljhrbM63j9ytTtNXw\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>But in general, these two things together represent a great opportunity for marketing success. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Phew. I then pivoted into the more workshop-y period of the session, starting with a simple framework I use often to introduce a structured way of thinking about marketing. It's based on the premise that a lot of folks start by thinking about marketing <em>activities</em> (OMG I need a Pinterest, like, yesterday!), without actually thinking about the higher-level marketing objectives that really match up with the business. I'll spare the narrative, but here are the slides I used to demonstrate the framework:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/16557?token=C58XiypihBL_CbeSR9Tqs7e13lN8guXyVt-hGXhRl-H3nchJyyh0CjFThVJa5uNOnkmEH0spjs14LJlElSizT7Q\" alt=\"SECON<em>Deck</em>v2.016.jpg\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/16558?token=HrQYcD-82a91YrdMGciOQA5WBIrTSWh6uXy_Is_j6RkycAgEZJhTlSpLun7ABw8BOBxX2cYfUgK5b9lmTj8sI2M\" alt=\"SECON<em>Deck</em>v2.017.jpg\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/16559?token=oF67Lo9U4DvIvE2Tx5c3QgNNL1lQjmRBGfXTuIIuxb8xTWRHN1H-wxviBsLxlOz6A9dfkJQw8DDYb8ukAHlJVAs\" alt=\"SECON<em>Deck</em>v2.018.jpg\" title=\"\" /> </p>\n\n<p>All in all, the workshop was a great experience and an awesome opportunity. The folks at HBS did a great job organizing (shocker) and all of the attendees and participants were beyond impressive. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, there are some really great social enterprise ideas out there, and I think lots of them line up <em>really</em> well with today's digital marketing tools and objectives. </p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-04-04T05:39:24.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-25T19:17:19.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-06-25T19:17:19.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"c3ac02fe-0c77-457c-bf55-9d34c878e476","title":"Why Yo Isn't Dumb At All, Yo","slug":"why-yo-isnt-dumb-at-all-yo","markdown":"\n![Yo Screenshot](https://draftin.com:443/images/17022?token=cXa9Rpd4Hi8rcsBnPWBguoW7wTMpd71xY_X3efGDrhVp_D3TZkSGudv6lxNVsBx3S7Ngt0wiktcl91m5UaTH76U) \n\nThere's been [a lot of buzz](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=yo+app&tbm=nws) about [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/) lately. It's a dead simple app that has only one feature: it lets you send a push notification to your friends with the message \"Yo!\" That's it. \n\nMany have bemoaned its stupidy, others have championed its simplicity. Personally, I find it amusing, if trivial. But there are a few reasons why I think it's gained popularity, and a few UX lessons to take away. \n\n####The 'ping' isn't a new concept\nWe've long talked about 'pinging' someone, whether they're across the office or across the ocean. It's a simple act of getting someone's attention, seeing what they are up to, or just letting them know you're thinking about them. Yet very few apps have made functionality that serves this very stripped-down use case - most require us to send some kind of additional message along with the ping. So it's not like Yo created a new behavior - it simply supports an incredibly simple and obvious existing behavior.\n####Push notifications *are* an interface\nMost mobile app interfaces happen within the application itself, and as designers and developers we're usually thinking about how people use our products when we have their full attention. But this is actually fairly uncommon - it's far more likely that users are doing [something other than using our app](http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/02/how-many-apps-do-you-use-a-month-study-shows-the-average-is-26-poll/) or site at any given moment. The result is that many of our interactions with services, particularly on mobile devices, occur in the form of push notifications. Other apps have embraced this ([ESPN's ScoreCenter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDcQFjAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fespn-sportscenter%2Fid317469184%3Fmt%3D8&ei=1Tm8U9GnE9PKsQSf4YLgCA&usg=AFQjCNGHyTocuMSoQYTuXCLwdT8iL4Y72g&sig2=Za8o7ISvUaSFxb3UlcY7fQ&bvm=bv.70138588,d.bGQ) comes to mind as an app I primarily interact with via notifications) but Yo takes the paradigm to its logical extreme, making the notification itself the whole of the interaction. \n####Short messages are really common\nI have saved shortcut on my iPhone keyboard that allows me to send the message 'Status' by double-tapping the `s` key, and it's probably the second most common thing I send via iMessage or SMS (the first is '10-4', shortcut `zz` to minimize distance from input field to keystroke). I'm sure I'm not alone in this \"micro-messaging\" behavior. Keyboard shortcuts are a nice way to accomplish my objective, but the fact is that for these use cases, a standard messaging UX is far more complicated than it needs to be. Yo fills a similar need - and those of my friends who use it are getting far fewer 'Status' messages from me these days. \n####Context is everything (and it always has been)\nA Yo at 10AM on a Monday from a colleague means something different than a Yo from a friend at 4:30PM on a Thursday. And they both mean something different than a Yo from an accomplice early on Sunday morning after a long night out. Context has always been a key to understanding when it comes to messaging (and all forms of communication, really) - often times it can communicate more information than the content of the message itself. So even with Yo's restrictive messaging capability - literally the same two characters every time - it remains remarkably adept at communicating sentiment. You really don't lose that much in translation, especially when you start adding dimensions like response time (how quickly I get a 'Yo' back), frequency (how often they 'Yo' me), and repetition (how many successive 'Yo's there are). \n####There will be more messages, silly\nThe radical simplicity of Yo is part of its novelty and a large reason for its strong initial traction, but that doesn't mean its utility would be entirely diluted by adding more messages. The interface could easily be tweaked to add more messages (think swiping the whole contact list right or left to move between 'Yo' and 'Sup'), and you can considerably increase its functionality without adding much friction or removing much of the user delight that goes with the current, uber-minimal approach. And if I could configure 4-5 of my own one word quips, it could probably steal another 10% of the interactions I currently have with iMessage.\n\nWill Yo become the hottest app of the century? Probably not. Will it ever be enough of a commercial success to justify the hype and funding it's received to date? Unlikely, in my opinion. But it most certainly isn't as stupid as it appears at first glance, and there are lots of little lessons to be learned when it comes to mobile, UX, and the way we'll all communicate in the future.
